VIM DOES NOT WORK WITH MAKE?

CHANGE ALL "source.temp..."  to "source.libs..." and "temp" to "libs"


fix cscope vim plugin and add other Java capabilities

fix Graph class and ensure that it actually works--appears that your nodes 
are not doubly linked and the graph is not correctly directed

add all the necessary README info

good code conventions and final variable usage

makefile should point all class files to bin folder which should be excluded
using gitignore

create test textfiles for each class

create a generic Input class similar to princeton.edu

correctly title all your source files.

add important and relevant problem tricks and things in the README

add Java8 versions of all current answers; if possible--using streams and such.


ISSUES WITH SRC CODE
--------------------
- graph creation not working in L4 P08 (Dijkstra)
- graph class created in temp/ not correct either
