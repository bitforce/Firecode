# Palindrome Tester

Overview
---

A palindrome is a string or sequence of characters that reads the same backward 
as forward. For example, "madam" is a palindrome. Write a method that takes in 
a String and returns a boolean -> true if the input String is a palindrome and 
false if it is not. An empty string and a null input are considered 
palindromes. You also need to account for the space character. For 
example, "race car" should return false as read backward it is 
"rac ecar".
