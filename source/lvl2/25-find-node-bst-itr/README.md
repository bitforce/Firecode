# Permutations

Overview
---
Given a binary tree, write a method to find and return the node with data 
equal to the input data. Do not use recursion. Return null if the node 
value does not exist.

Usage
---
`java BST X T`, where _X_ is the number to be searched in the _T_ node list.

Examples
* `java Permutations cat act`
* `java Permutations hello hola`

Note
---
This program is meant to return an object address if _X_ is found; null otherwise.
