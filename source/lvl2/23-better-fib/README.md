# Merge Two Sorted Arrays

Overview
---
Your goal is to write an optimal method - betterFibonacci that returns the nth 
Fibonacci number in the sequence. Your method should exhibit a runtime 
complexity of O(n) and use constant O(1) space. With this 
implementation, your method should be able to compute 
larger sequences where n > 40.

Usage
---
`java MergeSorted N`, where N is a reasonable integer.

Examples:
* `java MergeSorted BetterFibonacci 0`
* `java MergeSorted BetterFibonacci 10`
* `java MergeSorted BetterFibonacci 50` 

Note
---
Interesting enough, this implementation doesn't require memoization.
