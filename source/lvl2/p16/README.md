# Isomorphic Strings 

Overview
---
Given two strings - input1 and input2, determine if they are isomorphic. Two 
strings are isomorphic if the letters in one string can be remapped to get 
the second string. Remapping a letter means replacing all occurrences of 
it with another letter. The ordering of the letters remains unchanged. 
You can also think of isomorphism as it is used in chemistry - i.e. 
having the same form or overall shape. Target linear time and space 
complexity with your solution.
