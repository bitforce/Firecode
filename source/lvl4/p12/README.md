# Distance between two nodes in a Binary Tree 

Overview
---
Given the root of a Binary Tree  and 2 integers that represent the data values 
of any two TreeNodes present in the tree, write a method - getNodeDistance 
that returns the distance between the nodes. You can assume that the given 
keys exist in the tree. The distance between two nodes is defined as the 
minimum number of edges that must be traversed to travel between the two 
nodes.
