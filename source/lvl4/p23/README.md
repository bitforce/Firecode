# Mobile Game Range Module - Inserting Ranges 

Overview
---
A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Range modules are used extensively 
when designing scalable online game maps with millions of players. Your task is to write a 
method - insertRange that takes in an ArrayList of sorted, non-overlapping integer 
Interval s (aka ranges) and a new Interval - insert, and returns an ArrayList of 
sorted Interval s where insert has been added to the ArrayList in the correct 
spot and the required overlapping ranges have been merged. Target a time 
complexity of O(n).
