# Recovering IPv4 Addresses 

Overview
---
You are given a String containing at least 4 numbers that represented an IPv4 
Address, but the separator data - i.e. the dots that separate each Byte in a 
4 Byte Ipv4 address, has been lost. Write a method - generateIPAddrs that 
takes in this String and returns an ArrayList of Strings containing all 
possible IPv4 Addresses that can be generated from the given sequence 
of decimal integers.
