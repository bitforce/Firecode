# Recursive String Permutation

Overview
---
String permutations are the various possible strings made by the rearrangement of the characters in 
the original String. Write a recursive method getPermutations() that returns all permutations of 
an input String in an ArrayList. Define a helper method if needed. For the sake of simplicity, 
assume that all characters in the input String are unique.
