# Longest Non-Repeating Substring 

Overview
---
Given a String input, find the length of the longest substring that is made up 
of non-repeating characters. For ex, the longest substrings without repeated 
characters in “BCEFGHBCFG” are “CEFGHB” and “EFGHBC”, with length = 6. In 
the case of "FFFFF", the longest substring is "F" with a length of 1.
