# Rotate a Square Image Clockwise 

Overview
---
You are given a square 2D image matrix where each integer represents a pixel. 
Write a method rotateSquareImageCW to rotate the image clockwise - in-place. 
This problem can be broken down into simpler sub-problems you've already 
solved earlier! Rotating an image clockwise can be achieved by taking 
the transpose of the image matrix and then flipping it on its 
vertical axis.
