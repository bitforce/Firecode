# Print Paths

Overview
---
You're given a 2D board which contains an m x n matrix of chars - char[][]
board. Write a method - printPaths that prints all possible paths from the
top left cell to the bottom right cell. Your method should return an 
ArrayList of Strings, where each String represents a path with 
characters appended in the order of movement. You're only 
allowed to move down and right on the board. The order of 
String insertion in the ArrayList does not matter.
