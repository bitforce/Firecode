# Minimum Depth of a Tree

Overview
---
Write a non-recursive method minTreeDepth that takes in the root node of a 
Binary Tree and returns the minimum depth of the tree. The minimum depth 
is defined as the least number of node traversals needed to reach a leaf 
from the root node. Your method should run in linear O(n) time and use 
at max O(n) space.

My solution is not entirely correct since one of the constraints was to 
utilize a max of O(n) space.

_Solution 3 is not completely correct, but still recieved praise on the_
__Solution Overflow__ _section; it does not give the correct answer for 
when there only exist 2 nodes in the tree; however, it is still kept to 
show what the solution should have resembled if I did the stack 
implementation correctly._
