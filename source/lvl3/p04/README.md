# Find the kth Largest Node in a BST

Overview
---
Given a Binary Search Tree and an integer k, implement a method to find and return 
its kth largest node. We assume the tree is a BST (hint: you can more focus on the 
right side traversal).

Usage
---
N/A

Note
---
We use an outside tracker var to keep up with the nth largest element node; 
however, it is more favorable to have everything work inside one method--
code-brevity-wise. 

For the second findKthLargest(), there are two node-null-checks; may seem 
redundant, but they're not if you understand the code. We also use a 
stack as a way to 

Examples

1 4 2 8 5 10 -> 10
2 4 2 8 5 10 -> 8
5 4 2 8 5 10 -> 2
