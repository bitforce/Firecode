# Stock Market Oracle 

Overview
---

You've recently acquired market prediction superpowers that let you predict the 
closing stock price of a Acme Inc. 's stock a month into the future! To get the 
most out of this superpower, you need to write a method called maxProfit that 
takes in an array of integers representing the close out stock price on a 
given day. This method should return the maximum profit you can make out 
of trading Acme Inc.'s stock. There are a few limitations however: 

1)  You must sell your current holding before buying another - i.e. You may not 
    buy and then buy again. It needs to be a buy - sell - buy - sell ... 
    pattern. 

2)  You may complete as many transactions as you like. You're using an awesome 
    service like Robinhood, and so there are no transaction costs!

3)  If you're enormously unlucky (or karma takes over) and no profit can be 
    made, return 0.
