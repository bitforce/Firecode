# Happy Numbers

Overview
---
Write a method to determine whether a postive number is Happy. A number is 
Happy (Yes, it is a thing!) if it follows a sequence that ends in 1 after 
following the steps given below:

Beginning with the number itself, replace it by the sum of the squares of its 
digits until either the number becomes 1 or loops endlessly in a cycle that 
does not include 1.

Note

For some reason, isHappyNumber() did not pass test case, value 28, for 
Firecode.io solution engine; however, running it here gave me the 
correct answer. Not sure why, too tired to look into that rn. My 
original solution returns all the same booleans as method 
isHappyNumber2.
