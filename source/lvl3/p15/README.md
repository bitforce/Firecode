# Binary Tree Serialization

Overview
---
In Computer Science, serialization is the process of converting objects or data 
structures into a sequence (or series) of characters that can be stored easily 
in a file / database table or transmitted across a network. Serialized objects 
need to be de-serialized to create a semantically identical clone of the 
original object, before being used in programs. You're given the root 
node of a binary tree - TreeNode root in the method serializeTree.

This method should serialize the binary tree and output a String str, which is 
then used as an input parameter for the method restoreTree. restoreTree should 
create a Binary Tree that is structurally identical to the one you serialized 
and return the root node of the tree. Your task is to fill in the logic for 
these 2 methods. Don't worry about passing the serialized String to 
restoreTree - that will be done automatically when you run your 
code. Feel free to use any notation you prefer when serializing 
the binary tree. The choice of traversal algorithm is open, but
try and limit the time complexity of both methods to O(n).

Your serialized String will be used to restore the tree. Be sure to use the
same format and notation in restoreTree that you use to serialize in 
serializeTree().
