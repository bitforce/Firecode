# Find the Maximum Number of Repetitions  

Overview
---
Given an Array of integers, write a method that will return the integer with 
the maximum number of repetitions. Your code is expected to run with O(n) 
time complexity and O(1) space complexity. The elements in the array are 
between 0 to size(array) - 1 and the array will not be empty.
