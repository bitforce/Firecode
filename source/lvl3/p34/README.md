# Rotate a Square Image Counterclockwise 

Overview
---
You are given a square 2D image matrix where each integer represents a pixel. 
Write a method rotateSquareImageCCW to rotate the image counterclockwise - 
in-place. This problem can be broken down into simpler sub-problems you've 
already solved earlier! Rotating an image counterclockwise can be achieved 
by taking the transpose of the image matrix and then flipping it on its 
horizontal axis.
