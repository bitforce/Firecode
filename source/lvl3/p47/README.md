# Count Paths on a Game Board 

Overview
---
You're given a game board that has m x n squares on it, represented by an m x n 
array. Write a method - countPaths that takes in m and n and returns the number 
of possible paths from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. Only 
down and right directions of movement are permitted.

Note

Your method should output the result in a reasonable amount of time for large 
values of m and n. If you're thinking of using DFS, consider the tree depth 
and branching factor for m and n > 15!

m = number of rows, n = number of columns
