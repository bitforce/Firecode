# Firecode

Overview
---
These are all the problems I have completed on Firecode.io along with notes and 
resources I used to assist me.

Usage
---
When in a problem-folder; containing .java files, you can follow these steps to 
compile and execute the code:
```
make
make args=T
```
or...
```
javac FileName.java
java FileName [args]
```
Where for the latter compilation instructions, _args_ may possibly be optional; 
however, in the former, you write out _args_ and _T_ is a required, unless it 
simply required __make__ on its own to run. 

When done messing around with code and creating countless class files, be sure 
to use `./.clean.sh` to get rid of those--note: it is a hidden file.
