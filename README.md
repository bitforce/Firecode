# Firecode

Overview
---
These are all the problems I have completed on Firecode.io along with notes and 
resources I used to assist me.

Usage
---
When in a problem-folder; containing .java files, you can follow these steps to 
compile and execute the code:
```
javac FileName.java
java FileName [args]
```
Where _args_ may possibly be optional; however, if unsure be sure to look at the 
documentation within the source file or the README.

When done messing around with code and creating countless class files, be sure 
to use `./.clean.sh` to get rid of those--note: it is a hidden file.
