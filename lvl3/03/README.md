# Find the Number that Appears Once 

Overview
---
Write a method that returns a number that appears only once in an array.
Assume the array will surely have a unique value. The array will never 
be empty.

Usage
---
'java HappyNumber T', where _T_ is an array of integers.

Note
---
For some reason, isHappyNumber() did not pass test case, value 28, for 
Firecode.io solution engine; however, running it here gave me the 
correct answer. Not sure why, too tired to look into that rn. My 
original solution returns all the same booleans as method 
isHappyNumber2.

Examples
---
{1,1,1,4,5,6,7,7,6,4} ==> 5
{1,2,3,4,1,2,4,3,5}   ==> 5
